# JDDF Homebrew Tap

This repository is a ["tap"](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager.

You can use this tap to quickly install JDDF tools, assuming you already have
`brew` installed. Just run:

```bash
brew tap jddf/jddf

brew install jddf-codegen
brew install jddf-fuzz
brew install jddf-infer
```

Alternatively, you can install these packages directly (without the `brew tap`)
by running:

```bash
brew install jddf/jddf/jddf-codegen
brew install jddf/jddf/jddf-fuzz
brew install jddf/jddf/jddf-infer
```
